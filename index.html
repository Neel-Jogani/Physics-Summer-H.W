            <h3>~Circular motion is described as a movement of an object while rotating along a circular path. Circular motion can be either uniform or non-uniform. During uniform circular motion the angular rate of rotation and speed will be constant while during non-uniform motion the rate of rotation keeps changing.Some of the most common examples of circular motion include man-made satellite that revolves around the earth, a rotating ceiling fan, a moving car’s wheel, the blades in a windmill, and gears in gas turbines.~</h3>

            <h3>~Here we will be talking mainly about periodic motion. A motion that repeats itself after equal intervals of time is known as periodic motion. Examples of periodic motion are a tuning fork or motion of a pendulum if you analyze the motion you will find that the pendulum passes through the mean position only after a definite interval of time. We can also classify the above motion to be oscillatory. An oscillatory is a motion in which the body moves to and fro about a fixed position.~</h3>

            <h3>~This motion is one of the most common phenomena we come across in our daily lives. For example, a moving car, a kid running on the road or a fly moving in the air are all said to be in motion. So, in general terms, a body is said to be in motion if it changes its position with respect to a reference point and time.~</h3>

           <h3> ~Muscular power is the power applied utilizing portions of the body like arms or legs. It is a force that results because of the action of muscles and is a contact force since there is contact between the surfaces. Muscular force is required whenever the movement of the body occurs. Strolling, lifting, getting up from a seat, crossing a leg, and so 
            on all require muscular force.~</h3>

            <br>
            <h3>~Friction is the force that resists motion when the surface of one object comes in contact with the surface of another. The mechanical advantage of a machine is reduced by friction, or in other words, the ratio of output to input is reduced because of friction. An automobile uses one-quarter of its energy on limiting the friction. Yet, it is also friction in the tires that allows the car to stay on the road and friction in the clutch that makes it possible to drive. From matches to machines to molecular structures, friction is one of the most significant phenomena in the physical world. In this article, let us discuss frictional force and its different types.~</h3>

            <h3>~Magnetic force, attraction or repulsion that arises between electrically charged particles because of their motion. It is the basic force responsible for such effects as the action of electric motors and the attraction of magnets for iron. Electric forces exist among stationary electric charges; both electric and magnetic forces exist among moving electric charges. The magnetic force between two moving charges may be described as the effect exerted upon either charge by a magnetic field created by the other.~ </h3>

            <br>
            <h3>~The gravitational force is a force that attracts any two objects with mass. We call the gravitational force attractive because it always tries to pull masses together, it never pushes them apart. In fact, every object, including you, is pulling on every other object in the entire universe! This is called Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation. Admittedly, you don't have a very large mass and so, you're not pulling on those other objects much. And objects that are really far apart from each other don't pull on each other noticeably either. But the force is there and we can calculate it.~</h3>

            <h3>~The electrostatic force is an attractive and repulsive force between particles are caused due to their electric charges. The electric force between stationary charged body is conventionally known as the electrostatic force. It is also referred to as Columb’s force.This Columb Interaction is named after the French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. Electrostatic Force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. We make use of the Coulomb’s Law to solve the forces created by configurations of charge.~</h3>

        <br>
        <h3>~In everyday use and in kinematics, the speed (commonly referred to as v) of an object is the magnitude of the rate of change of its position with time or the magnitude of the change of its position per unit of time; it is thus a scalar quantity.[1] The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval;[2] the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero.~</h3>

        <br>
        <h3>~The terms velocity and speed give us an idea of how fast or slow an object is moving. Quite often, we come across situations where we need to identify which of the two or more objects is moving faster. One can easily tell the faster of the two if they are moving in the same direction on the same road. However, if their direction of motion is in the opposite direction, then it is difficult to determine the fastest~</h3>
